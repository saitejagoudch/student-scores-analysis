# 📊 Student Scores Analysis with Pandas

## 📝 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and managing student performance data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**. The objective is to simulate student scores for various graduate courses, perform statistical analyses, and derive meaningful insights through data manipulation techniques. The project covers data creation, modification, filtering, aggregation, and performance evaluation.

## 📊 **Dataset Description**

The dataset simulates student scores for three graduate courses:

- **Courses:** CS 5000, CS 5110, CS 5600
- **Students:** Alice, Mark, Bill, Tony, Jason, Ravi, Sandeep, Mounika, John, Curtis, and David
- **Score Range:** Random integers between 30 and 100

Each student has scores recorded for the three courses, and additional columns are calculated for average scores, GPA, and academic status.

## 🔍 **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Creation:**

   - Simulating random scores using `NumPy` with predefined seeds for reproducibility.
   - Organizing the data into `Pandas Series` and `DataFrames`.

2. **Data Manipulation:**

   - Adding new student records.
   - Filtering data based on score conditions.
   - Sorting data by multiple criteria.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**

   - Calculating average scores.
   - Assigning letter grades based on score thresholds.
   - Computing GPA using a weighted credit system.

4. **Performance Evaluation:**

   - Classifying students into academic standing categories (Honor Roll, Normal, In Probation).
   - Updating and correcting specific student records.

5. **Data Cleaning:**

   - Dropping unnecessary columns for final presentation.

## 📈 **Key Analyses & Operations**

### 1. **Score Simulation:**

- Used `NumPy` to generate random integers representing student scores.
- Created individual records (e.g., David) and integrated them into the main dataset.

### 2. **Top Performers Identification:**

- Retrieved the top 3 students in **CS 5000** using `nlargest()`.

### 3. **Conditional Filtering:**

- Identified students with CS 5000 scores > 80 and CS 5110 scores < 60.

### 4. **Sorting:**

- Sorted CS 5000 scores in ascending order and CS 5110 in descending order simultaneously.

### 5. **Data Correction:**

- Corrected John's CS 5600 score to reflect the accurate value.

### 6. **Statistical Metrics:**

- Calculated the average score across courses for each student.
- Assigned letter grades for CS 5000 based on defined score brackets.

### 7. **GPA Calculation:**

- Applied GPA scaling (4.0 system) using course credit weights.
- Incorporated letter grades (A-F) into GPA computations.

### 8. **Academic Status Classification:**

- Categorized students into "Honor Roll," "Normal," and "In Probation" based on GPA.
